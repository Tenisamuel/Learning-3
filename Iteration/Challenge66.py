#The program asks the user to enter the size in m square of an area that needs tiling. The user then selects
#The size of tiles they want from a range of sizes given in cm. The program tells them how many tiles 
#they would need (Ten percent is added to the caculated number to allow for tiles that need to be cut, and
#this number is rounded down to the nearest whole number)

#Copy and complete the program and save it in your own folder.

#Test your completed program by entering 20cm for tile length, 12cm for tile width and 2.4m square for area to
#covered.The integer number of tiles required, including the 10% extra, is 110.
