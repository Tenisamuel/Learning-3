#Write a program which asks  the user to enter in the format hhmmss the number of hours, minutes and seconds
#taken by a runner to complete a marathon. Call a subroutine to convert the number of seconds. In the main 
#program, print the number of seconds taken. (TIP: use string slicing)

#Test your program by entering a time of 2 hours, 1 minute and 1 second in the format 020101. The expected result
#IS 7261 SECONDS.

#What happens if you enter 211 instead of 020101.
