# Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number and then prints the sum of all numbers from 1 to that number. 
# The program should use a while loop to calculate the sum.

# Example
# Enter a positive integer: 5
# The sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is 15

# In this example, the sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is 
# 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
# 1+2+3+4+5=15.
